# hspec-discover

Automatically discover and run Hspec tests.

It is a useful convention to have one spec file for each source file. That way it is straightforward to find the corresponding spec for a given piece of code. But it requires error prone, and neither challenging nor interesting boiler plate code. So it should be automated. Hspec provides a solution for that. It makes creative use of GHC's support for custom preprocessors.
