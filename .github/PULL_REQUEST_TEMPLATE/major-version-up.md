Hello - thanks for contributing to Habitat Core Plans!

You've indicated that you're incrementing the major version of software packaged as a Habitat Core Plan. Please review and include the following information:

- [ ] A link to the upstream Release notes or Changelog.

If the Plan doesn't include a tests directory, please describe how we can verify that the resulting package is working as intended.  If this version includes new features, please include those in the description. Please read [RFC0004](https://github.com/habitat-sh/core-plans-rfcs/blob/master/_RFCs/0004-testing-pull-requests.md) for more details

- [ ] Description of how to validate the package **OR** addition of tests to validate the package.

If the upstream source of the software supports multiple major versions,  please apply [RFC0003](https://github.com/habitat-sh/core-plans-rfcs/blob/master/_RFCs/0003-tracking-package-versions.md) and add Plans to track those major versions.

- [ ] Add additional plans to track previous Major versions (if applicable)
